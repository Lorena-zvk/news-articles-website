      These are only some of the words used by musicians to describe Rockehuset, the heart and soul of rock music in
      Halden.

        Initially designed as a bomb shelter during the Cold War to protect the population of Halden against
        a potential nuclear attack, decades down the line this place still protects the people that live here,
        but in quite a different manner. The unused cave has now been transformed into

        ,
        the first rehearsal
        house to ever exist in Norway, whose main goal is to shelter and encourage the passion for music of anyone who
        passes their threshold. For these people, the rock house is a second home, a place that they will never forget,
        that will never leave their hearts, nor will Rockehuset ever forget` them, the proof to this being the many

        of past artists that still hang on the walls of the bomb shelter, greeting the new and curious minds and
        inspiring
        them to dream as big as they possibly can.

        Situated in the middle of downtown Halden, Rockehuset is part of a project owned by Halden county.
        The area is surrounded by several houses and a shopping mall, but missing it would be very difficult
        considering its facade. The rock house is actually a cave, built into a rock formation that really catches
        one’s eye. Once inside, you are met by rock walls, covered in professionally-designed graffiti that create
        an atmosphere which speaks to every rocker’s heart. You can find different rehearsal rooms, a recording room,
        a concert hall, a “Hip-Hop” room and some “drop-in” rooms, which are rooms created for people who are interested
        in experimenting with music, but have no means of doing that. These rooms offer musical instruments that are
        free
        to use for any visitor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, Rockehuset has become a shelter in every sense of the word, hosting artists still in their
        infancy that would later become big names in the music industry, such as Henning Kvitnes, Mork, Lucky Malice
        and many others. Among these artists, the rock house also hosts many young people that are looking for a career,
        an escape, or just a reason to “get out of the house”, as one of the young artists there told us in an
        interview.
        Another important aspect of Rockehuset is its attentiveness towards mental health awareness. Not only does it
        inspire
        and assist youths in their most vulnerable years, but it has also been involved in the State’s escalation plan
        for
        mental health back in 2005, by supplying more jobs at the establishment, thus increasing the opportunities to
        utilize
        Rockehuset’s equipment and benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the care that Rockehuset offered to the community has not gone unnoticed. You can really call this
        place the epicenter of music in Halden, all the people that ever went there getting irrevocably attached
        to the place. Just as the rock house was fighting for their sake, the music community was also fighting for
        their safe haven, as Rockehuset was close to being shut down on many occasions, its only salvation being the
        involvement of all the people that refused to stay silent when the place was threatened with loss of funds.

        When we went there to see the place in person, we got the chance to meet some of the people that hold
        Rockehuset in such high regard, these young people being the members of the band L.I.A.R:

        . At such young ages, they have already
        decided on a musical career and they are working hard towards it, practicing multiple times a week and even
        writing
        their own songs. All of this was possible only through the existence of the rock house, which facilitated a safe
        space for them to meet, become friends, form a band and evolve from there.

        All of them are capable of calling Rockehuset a “second home” in a split second, without a trace of hesitation.
        This, along with the talent they displayed in their concert and the words from their interview emphasize what
        the
        spirit of the music community really is like and what Rockehuset means to everyone. Rockehuset began as a safe
        haven
        in case of life-threatening disaster and, after many years of hardships, it managed to remain one to this day
        because,
        even if its shape is different, its essence, its goal to protect the people of Halden, still remains.
