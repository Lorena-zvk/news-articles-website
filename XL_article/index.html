            <h2>The beginning of a new transportation era...</h2>
            <p>The term hitchhiking refers to an individual asking for a ride from a stranger whether taking him or her
                to the
                desired destination or to the nearest station or location. Even though the ride is regarded as free, the
                exchange
                may be discussed and it’s entirely between the driver and the hiker to come to an agreement with each
                other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hitchhiking has been a very common practice ever since World War II, when cars were very hard to come by
                because
                of the lack of gasoline and the tires and other necessities that were hard to obtain. Among the normal
                population
                that needed transportation during their daily life, there were also many soldiers that were trying to
                get around.

                The practice had declined dramatically during the 21st century, the primary reason being distrust and
                fear of strangers.
                Nowadays, hitchhiking is often perceived as dangerous, and few drivers are willing to pick someone up in
                their car. Police
                departments discourage it, and many states explicitly ban it. Very few people are now resorting to this
                method of transport,
                and usually only as a last resort when they have no other choice.

            <h2>Is hitchhiking truly dangerous?</h2>
            <p>
                Most experts agree that one of the biggest factors in the decline of hitchhiking has nothing to do with
                the
                existing worries for one’s safety. It’s mostly about the huge growth we’ve seen in car ownership in the
                last few
                decades. As mentioned above, when hitching became popular, cars, gas and other parts were very difficult
                to come by,
                so this was pretty much the only way of transportation for a lot of people. Over the past couple of
                decades, cars have
                lasted longer and became cheaper. Since the 1960’s, the percentage of US households that owned cars has
                steadily increased
                and the proportion of those with more than one vehicle has grown even faster.
                A similar growth can be seen in Great Britain as well. The Government’s statistics (“Social Trends
                Pocketbook”, 2000)
                show that “only three out of ten households [...] had a car in 1961, but by 1998 seven out of ten
                households had at
                least one”.
            </p>
            <img src="photos/graph.JPG">
            <p>
                The widespread fear of hitchhiking is most probably motivated, not by evidence, but by other trends,
                such as Smith’s
                theory about the bad reputation and the title of “weirdo” that would be assigned to people who choose
                hitching. This
                general fear can also fit into a more general fear of strangers that has surfaced in American society
                over the past few
                decades. Parents will strictly instruct their children never to talk to strangers, but in reality, the
                overwhelming majority
                of child abductions are committed by family members.

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>
                        In much the same way, about 30,000 people die in car accidents every year, but the few dozen who
                        are murdered along
                        the highways make hitchhiking a much more palpable threat than driving. Our perceived fear of
                        hitchhiking has surpassed
                        the actual risk of it.

                            “There’s a kind of safety bug that’s taken over in society. We’re much more reluctant to
                            interact with
                            strangers than before.” - Alan Pisarski

                Another reason why hitchhiking has become less and less popular is not only that people are scared to
                ask strangers for rides,
                but also the fact that drivers are afraid of picking them up. Much of this has to do with the way in
                which hitchhikers are perceived.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graeme Chesters and David Smith wrote a sociological research paper back in 2001, called “The Neglected
                Art of Hitch-hiking:
                Risk, Trust and Sustainability”. Here they theorize that the effect of the increase of car ownership and
                access was to
                “normalise car use and thus to marginalise those without access to a car, including hitch-hikers”.
                Therefore, the people
                who were still resorting to hitching became by definition “deviant - suspect, disreputable, risky,
                abnormal and potentially
                dangerous, as criminals or people with mental disorders”. From a social point of view, the car became
                “the major item of
                individual consumption which provides status to its owner/user through the sign - values with which it
                is associated
                (speed, safety, career success, freedom, masculinity)” (Urry, 2000).
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, owning a car meant that you were a normal and successful person in the eyes of society,
                while the opposite
                made you a “weirdo” or even “potentially dangerous”. This social phenomenon heavily impacted
                hitchhikers, because people
                were more cautious and paranoid about letting a stranger in their car. A social group that suffered
                severely from these
                events were college students. In their situation, owning a car was impossible in most cases, making
                hitchhiking their only
                alternative. This, however, did not exempt them from the growing anxiety towards hitchhikers. Therefore,
                this method of
                transportation ceased to be an accessible, or even a thinkable, practice for many students who intended
                to preserve their
                status and reputation, leading to the slow disappearance of hitching that we can see today.

                Arguably hitchhiking can give the hiker a thrilling adventure and an amazing experience, but let's not
                to forget how hitchhiking
                can pose a potential risk and furthermore, the stranger behind the wheel may not have only good
                intentions.
                The warning signs about hitchhiking are high, and an individual participating in this practice must take
                a lot of precautions
                and be highly alert at all times.
                The hiker might experience a driver who has malicious intentions, therefore traveling
                as a someone with a nomad lifestyle requires a lot of discipline and a deep understanding of the
                potential danger.

                Going back to the United States, during the same period when car ownership was increasing, the
                Interstate
                Highway System was built,
                connecting most of the big cities with much faster roads that became the basis for most long-distance
                travel. Traveling at higher
                speeds made picking up a hitcher much more difficult than when people were slowly driving around smaller
                towns. While hitchhiking
                is not explicitly banned on all interstates, laws prohibit pedestrians from walking alongside them, so
                getting a ride became much
                more difficult. Meanwhile, a few states have made hitchhiking entirely illegal, while others have only
                banned it on highways.
                The vast majority of states permit it, but with additional laws that prohibit hitchers to stay on the
                road
                itself. While these
                laws aren’t always enforced, Alan Pisarski says that they’ve made hitching riskier and served as a
                deterrent.

                Starting in the 1960s and ‘70s, some of the first laws against hitchhiking were passed and local and
                federal law enforcement
                agencies began using scare tactics to get both drivers and hitchhikers to stop doing it. For instance,
                in 1973, the FBI
                released a poster to the public that warned drivers that a hitcher might be a “sex maniac” or a “vicious
                murderer”.

                Along with all this propaganda also came Hollywood. It’s difficult to tell if real-life hitching crimes
                preceded their
                horror movie counterparts, but starting in the 1950s and then gaining traction in the ‘70s and ‘80s, the
                “psychopathic
                hitchhiker” trope was born.

                The propaganda, followed by all the horror movies, seems to have achieved its goal, because the fear
                regarding hitchhiking
                grew exponentially. In the present, most of the people don’t even take the idea into consideration
                because they deem it
                way too risky and dangerous to even attempt it. This became a dominant perception around the world,
                despite the fact that
                there is no actual evidence that declares hitchhiking as being that dangerous.
            </p>
            <p>
                In her op-ed, Strand states that we’ve never had good evidence that hitchhikers - or the drivers who
                pick them up
                - are particularly likely to be raped or murdered. One of the very few studies on the topic, conducted
                by the California
                Highway Patrol in 1974, concluded that “the results… do not show that hitchhikers are over represented
                in crimes or
                accidents beyond their numbers”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The study did find that women were more likely to be raped than men while hitchhiking, a fact that is
                obviously still
                true in the present, but most murders, violent injuries and rapes are committed at home by a friend,
                family member or
                acquaintance of the victim. According to the FBI, between 1979 and 2009, there were only 675 cases of
                murder or sexual
                assault along the Interstates, and not all of them involved hitchhikers.

                    Meghan Moe Beitiks began hitchhiking in the ‘90s as a “radical experiment in trust”,
                      as she called it. She was never physically harmed in her travels, but there were a few times when she was made
                       uncomfortable by her driver’s advances. In those cases, she responded firmly and politely and asked to be let out of
                        the car, but for the most part, she had positive experiences because of being a female hitchhiker, not in spite of it.

                   He is an exchange student in Norway, from The Czech Republic who has been hitchhiking ever since he was 15 years old.
                    In this time interval, he has traveled through over eight countries and hitched in over 600 cars. Whenever someone 
                    encounters him, he will have a different or new story to tell. 
               </p>
               <p>
                After he finished highschool, he decided to pack his bags and start traveling around Europe. When we asked about 
                his experience with hitchhiking, he told us many stories about the people he met and the places he’s been to. He
                 says that hitchhiking is actually really safe and it offers you the chance to meet so many new people and discover a lot of
                  opportunities. One time in his travels, he was even offered a job. He went on to talk about his time in Austria, where he 
                  went to improve his German and met a guy that took him around and showed him beautiful places that most tourists don’t get to see.

                He told us about a time when he encountered one of his brother’s university professors with whom he had a deep and beautiful
                 conversation about life. Another time, he ended up singing along to random songs with a 80 year old lady that picked him 
                 up and then there was the time when he hitchhiked to Halden, for his exchange programme here.

                When we asked him if he was never worried about hitching, especially for such long trips, he told us that he was used to 
                it and it was “riskier for the person that takes you into their car”. After all these years hitchhiking, he has become very 
                accustomed to it and feels very comfortable around strangers. His worst experience has been a lady in her forties that went 
                on to complain to him, or “get crazy”, as he described it, about her husband and men in general.

                Even if he feels comfortable when traveling with strangers, Ondřej still needs to keep his mind open to potential risks.

            </div>

                When he was asked whether he would encourage anyone to follow his lifestyle, he responded with a very cheerful and 
                firm “Yes!”. He sees hitchhiking as a very safe and amazing way to travel the world:

                    “I would highly recommend it. If it wouldn’t be safe, I wouldn’t recommend it. It’s the best way to travel,
                     because you can get to know new countries and their culture, you get to meet new people and it is always very pleasant.
                      It’s great for students! It is a very cheap alternative and you get to travel without a care in the world. So I would 
                      recommend it for everybody to just try it and see for themselves.”

                Even in the present, with so much fear surrounding the concept of hitchhiking, there are still people who appreciate its charm
                 and many benefits and will not let themselves be discouraged by rumours and irrational anxiety. These are the people that will
                  keep this art alive for many years to come.

                With all the technology that has been developed in the latest years, new ways of ride-sharing have appeared.
                 More recently, smartphones and location-based apps have allowed people to share rides with strangers again. 
                 They make this process seem a lot safer by providing information about them, usually through social media profiles, 
                 like Facebook. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These apps take quite a few different forms. There’s CabCorner, Via, UberPool and Lyft Line, which allow you to
                 split a ride with people nearby who need to get to a similar destination. The Hovee app matches you with coworkers 
                 or other commuters who share a similar route to work and Carma Carpooling does the same, but charges riders and pays
                  the drivers to offset gas costs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, it’s clear that all of these are quite a bit different from someone hitching a ride by sticking their
                 thumb out on the side of the road, but it achieves the same basic benefit of putting otherwise empty seats in cars
                  to good use, therefore reducing traffic, and allowing people with no other means of transportation to arrive at their
                   desired destinations.

        “From a transportation capacity standpoint, the biggest wasted resource we have is all those empty seats. Anything we can

            Overall, hitchhiking is a mode of transportation that solves more problems than it creates. It allows people to discover 
            the world and meet so many new characters that could heavily influence your life in good ways. It allows you to experience
             new and unexpected things, from which you will come out with stories that will linger with you throughout your entire lifetime. 
             Of course, the risks that people fear all the time are still there, but bad things rarely actually occur and they can usually
              be avoided with a bit of precaution and some safety measures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The benefits highly overweight the risks when it comes to hitchhiking and no one who has an interest in this activity
             should let themselves be discouraged by a general fear created from propaganda and Hollywood movies. In my personal opinion,
              I believe it’s time to put all these fears aside and let ourselves be encouraged by those who have already had all these 
              incredible experiences to start believing in people’s kindness again and bring back that golden era of “good feeling”
               when people were actually comfortable around each other.
