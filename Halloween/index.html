        A fright night spook festival, Halloween is a little different than other special holiday seasons we’re used to.
        The celebration of Halloween has long historical roots that can be traced back to the Celtic celebration of
        Samhain, as a part of pagan religious belief. Halloween’s origin evolved from Hallowe’en, and over time, the
        name slowly got shortened down to “hallowed evening”, referring to All Hallows’ Eve, later to Halloween.

      </p>
      <p>
        Halloween is wildly popular across the countries - unlike the contemporary holiday seasons and is loved by
        people young and old. Occurs every year on the last day of October - marking the end of summer. The season
        deliberately exploits a way to experience the fun and fright during the first day of winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second most popular holiday in the US, millions of people around the world gather around on the night of
        31st of October, put on a costume and for one night they pretend like our childhood monsters are real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Holidays like Halloween are deeply rooted in history and folklore and have evolved throughout the centuries.
        Today, we are far from the once Celtic festival of Samhain when people would dress up to ward off ghosts.
        Ironically, today we tend to dress up in hopes of finding ghosts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every part of the world has its own legends and myths, some more frightening than others, but all equally
        captivating.
        In a Celtic folklore, it’s believed spirits are roaming the physical world on this special occasion, the
        boundaries between worlds are opening for these spirits to come and go as pleased but only on Halloween.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the actual practice didn’t require the participant to wear costumes, it had evolved during times and
        undergone some changes. The purpose was to ward off various supernatural beings because it’s believed that the
        worlds between the spirit and physical world have been opened during this time.
        In addition, offering food to the dead was another way for the Celtic to connect with the spirit.

      </p>
      <p>
        There is a long history of how Halloween came to be, the background is immense with an in-depth on the
        importance of this holiday. The fright wasn’t necessarily part of Halloween in the past, in fact, it’s a part of
        pagan religious ritual with building bonfires and celebrating the dead.
        Surely, Halloween has changed and diverted from its root, transforming the tradition with a twist.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Halloween emphasizes the celebration of the ghosts and those who have died, it's obvious that this
        can be linked to the spookiness.
        The whole Halloween tradition and practice originates from ancient Celtic which is now known as Ireland,
        Halloween didn’t arrive in the States until the 19th century and has been adopted as an official holiday season
        since then.

          <h2>Skinwalker: </h2>
          <p>
            In the Navajo culture, a skinwalker originates from a shaman who practices black magic, and hunger for power
            has led a shaman into a creature.
            A skinwalker should not be mentioned because the Navajo peoples believe that once mentioned its name, that
            skinwalker will come calling.
            The power a skinwalker possesses is the ability to transform into animals, preferably a creature which
            resembles a large wolf/dog, but they can shapeshift as well.
          </p>
          <img src="pictures/skinwalker.JPG">
          <h2>Wendigo: </h2>
          <p>
            Also known as “windigo”, which has its root from Canadian indigenous peoples (the Algonquin).
            A wendigo is a cannibalistic malevolent spirit which seeks to possess a human body and goes on a feasting
            rampage.
            Because of their insatiable thirst for human flesh, no matter how much flesh they have consumed, it will
            never be enough.
            This sounds pretty similar to a skinwalker, however, there’s a vast difference and can be distinguished
            easily.
            What a wendigo’s spirit will do is to seek out a human being and possess that body. Undertake the host
            slowly as it influences the human into greed and hunger, causing the human to slowly undergo a
            transformation.

            Wendigo appearance: Tall, usually 7ft (2m + or taller), extremely thin (due to starvation) with bones
            protruding from its body, the head may change slightly from what a human used to look like.

            Baba Yaga is a witch who resembles a sweet grandmother. Baba Yaga however is far from being your average

            for centuries.

            Baba Yaga’s appearances: Not a sweet grandmother. She appears to be an ugly old woman with poor hygiene. The
            way how someone would imagine an old hag would look like, this is an alternative version of how an old witch
            would look like.
            The facial features would consist of a huge and long distorted nose and long ugly teeth.

            uncertain to say if the bunyip has ever been known as a cryptid creature or an unknown folklore creature

          <h2>Yara-ma-yha-who: </h2>
          <p>
            A part of the aboriginal folklore, this creature is a blood-sucking creature that lurks in the trees. It’s
            expected the creature to locate on the highest top of the tree, as it waits for their prey to come by and
            stand under the tree before the Yara-ma-yha-who would descend down and suck the blood before swallowing the
            person whole.

        If we take out the context, hearing that people enjoy dressing up as monsters and scaring each other and then
        call it
        a holiday, seems like a strange situation. However, the existence and prominence of such a tradition is
        completely expected
        when we take into consideration humanity’s collective fascination with death, myths and the overall mystery of a
        paranormal world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Year after year horror movies and haunted houses are an absolute success. People voluntarily sign up to be
        scared and most of
        them enjoy the experience. When researching why we take pleasure in watching scary things or putting ourselves
        through a terrifying
        experience, the consensus was that it all comes back to control. We love being scared in an environment that we
        can manipulate.
        We can turn off that movie or decide to not go through another haunted maze. Nobody actually craves to be in
        serious danger,
        however the controlled danger we feel when indulging in such activities gives us a much needed rush of
        adrenaline. On top of
        that, it can also make us feel proud for conquering certain fears.

        With an interview from a student who claims Halloween to be her favorite holiday, her opinion has strengthened
        the holiday even further.

      </p>
      <div class="interview">

          “Halloween is actually my favorite holiday. I love the idea of having the freedom to be whoever or whatever
          you want, it allows people to show a part of their true selves. I’m also a real fan of everything that is
          considered scary, like haunted houses, horror movies and so on. I love the rush of adrenaline you get from
          being scared, it’s euphoric. And you can only enjoy that in a controlled environment, where your brain knows
          that nothing bad will actually happen to you.” - Flavia Bogdan

      <h3>Halloween in Norway</h3>
      <p>
        Halloween didn’t arrive in Norway until the 2000 through Sweden, it started slow and didn’t make a breakthrough
        until some years later. A totally uncommon season which isn’t considered as official to the Norwegian tradition,
        but throughout time it has gradually become acceptable and here to stay.
        During recent years, this international tradition has found its way and is part of Norwegian culture.

      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Ireland, celebrating Halloween in Norway is practiced as a spooky activity for fun, good for marketing
        and commercials. Moving away from what it originally meant to be, Halloween in Norwegian style consists of a
        dress up party, either public or private, and has nothing to do with celebrating the homecoming of the spirits.
        While Halloween celebration in Norway is nonetheless short and the home decoration isn’t much of a hype.
        Since it’s not what the Norwegian recall it as completely official despite it being confirmed as one. Generally
        speaking the concept of having Halloween in Norway is more towards marketing purposes rather than the actual
        practice of the Celtics.
      </p>
      <p>
        While spending a lot of effort on setting up Halloween home decoration for the occasion is normal for
        English-speaking countries, however, in Norway, they would spend more time on setting up Christmas holiday or
        preparing for Christmas decoration more so.
        The trend for trick-or-treating can be daunting, as some Norwegian households refuse to open the door for
        strangers and the sweets aren’t always available like what they are used to in England or the US.

        Although the celebration of Halloween isn’t part of the tradition and isn’t big in Norway, still, it's proof
        that this unorthodox holiday manages to break the Norwegian norms and is here to stay.

      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, holidays like Halloween bring a very important thing back into this modern world, magic and
        wonder.
        Throughout the passing of time, we as people forgot to look around and enjoy the mysteries of nature around us,
        we stopped
        believing in fairytales and, as a result, stopped believing in the monsters that we once knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, creatures were a way in which humans could explain why and how atrocities happen. It was easier to
        point to a
        ghost or an evil spirit than to admit the dangerous one might be your neighbour. Today we know that most bad
        things are done
        by the people around us but for one night it is fun to forget all about real life and take a leap into the
        darker side of things.
