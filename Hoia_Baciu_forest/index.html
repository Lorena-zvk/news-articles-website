                If hearing “Romania” makes your mind jump only to images of Dracula, mythical creatures and haunted
                places,
                you wouldn’t be the only one to experience this. For the untrained eye, the mysticism surrounding this
                country
                mostly comes from its portrayal in the western media and Bram Stoker’s novel, but, in reality, it all
                stems from
                folklore and old superstitions passed down from one generation to the other. Among all the haunted
                places Romania
                has to offer, one stands out more.

            <h5>
                This place is called the ‘Hoia-Baciu” forest.
            </h5>
            <p>
                Situated on the northwestern border, at the outskirts of the city Cluj-Napoca, the forest gained a lot
                of recognition from
                the multitude of stories about ghost sightings, UFO’s, inexplicable disappearances and rumors about a
                portal to the other world.
                This has caused an uproar in the supernatural community, which led to the place being flooded by
                tourists. The forest became a
                very popular camping spot and many people started offering night tours for those who wanted to witness
                real-life supernatural activity.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="part">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>
                        While a popular tourist destination is always good for the economy of the surrounding area, all
                        good things come at a cost. In this case, the cost is the forest itself. After years of being
                        rampaged by inconsiderate tourists in search of a wonderful paranormal story, the place looks
                        less like an enchanted forest and more like the sad remains of what used to be a natural
                        paradise. The forest has been filled with garbage left behind by the people and even paved roads
                        started appearing in the middle of the forest, in order to make the tours easier. Slowly, but
                        surely, the exact reason that made this forest so beautiful and popular will become the reason
                        why it will disappear. The people that make it a habit to take walks through Hoia-Baciu can
                        notice these effects with their bare eyes:

                <p>I was in Hoia Baciu somewhere around autumn in October 2020.
                    The experience I can describe is how the atmosphere is very quiet, in general.
                    It's quite of a surprise to see there are still people walking in this area regarding how
                    secluded and relatively far out of town it is.
                    Recently in May 2021 during spring time, I did a revisit of
                    the forest and this time I didn't notice much garbage. However,
                    last fall when I ventured deeper in the forest, there were some garbage bags tossed around.
                </p>
                <i class="fas fa-quote-right fa-2x" id="quote-right"></i>
            </div>
            <p>
                said Andrea Blaga, a student in Cluj-Napoca, regarding her experience in the forest.

        <div class="part">
            <p>
                Moreover, another factor that contributes to the forest’s destruction is the illegal deforestation that
                happens daily in many parts of Romania. This is a situation that everyone is aware of, but very little
                has been done about it. Trees are disappearing one by one, at an alarming rate, going to such extremes
                that improvised roads have started to appear in order to make taking the wood out of there easier.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="part">
            <p>
                When asked if she believed the forest to be an exploited area, Andrea did not hesitate to affirm:
            </p>
            <div class="interview">
                <i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x" id="quote"></i>
                <p>
                    Yes, it seems to me that every time I was there were traces of cutting. There are always trees that
                    have
                    been just cut down.
                    Especially in the deeper parts of the forest.
                </p>
                <i class="fas fa-quote-right fa-2x" id="quote-right"></i>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="part">
            <p>
                This all shows the staggering rise of the forests being used as a dumping ground for waste and also how
                difficult it is to prevent the deforestation from happening. Nevertheless, we, as humans, can contribute
                to the salvation of the forests and the planet itself. In the midst of a harness of ignorance and greed,
                getting things done is easier said than done. A first step towards improving the environment would be to
                utilize our knowledge and learn to appreciate and preserve the natural beauty that lays right in front
                of us. For the sake of this forest, that has brought so much happiness to both the supernatural
                community and nature lovers, someone has to take a stand. One can’t simply take things for granted and
                still believe that the nature won’t change for the worse.
